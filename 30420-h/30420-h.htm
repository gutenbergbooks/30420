<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">The</span> Editor is most grateful to the various authors who
have willingly given their consent to the use of their
respective poems in the compilation of this volume. It
has been a somewhat difficult problem, not only to select the
more appropriate productions, but also to find the names of their
authors, for in his Lincoln collection there are many hundreds
of poems which have appeared from time to time in magazines,
newspapers and other productions, some of which are accompanied
by more than one name as author of the same poem. In
a number of instances it has been difficult to ascertain the name
of the actual owner of the copyright, the poems having been
printed in so many forms without the copyright mark attached.</p>

<p>The Editor in particular <a name="trans1" id="trans1">extends his grateful acknowledgment</a>
to the Houghton Mifflin Company for permission to reprint
the "Emancipation Group" by John G. Whittier; the "Life
Mask" by Richard Watson Gilder; "The Hand of Lincoln" by
Clarence Stedman; "Commemoration Ode" by James Russell
Lowell, and the "Gettysburg Address" by Bayard Taylor; to
Charles Scribner's Sons for two "Lincoln" poems by Richard
Henry Stoddard; and to the J.&nbsp;B. Lippincott Company for the
poem "Lincoln" by George Henry Boker.</p>

<p>The Editor is also grateful to Dr. Marion Mills Miller for his
contribution of the introduction and a poem specially written
for the collection, and also for assistance in the editorial work.</p>

<h3><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">No</span> great man has ever been spoken of with such tender
expressions of high regard as has been Abraham Lincoln.
Especially is this true of the tributes of esteem made
by the poets to his memory. It is therefore desirable that these
should be preserved for future generations, and at this time, the
fiftieth anniversary of his untimely death, it is peculiarly proper
that they should be presented to the public.</p>

<p>Although they are chiefly the productions of American authors,
quite a number are from the pens of appreciative citizens of other
countries. From the thousand of meritorious poems which
have been written about Lincoln, the compiler, after serious
consideration, has selected those within as appearing to be gems;
although there were others which he would have been glad to
include if space permitted.</p>

<p>The poems and illustrations are arranged largely in the chronological
order of their application to the events in the life of
Lincoln. The intense sympathy and warm appreciation portrayed
therein for our Martyred President, as well as their
artistic merit assure the poems a sacred place in the heart of
every patriotic American.</p>

<p>The large number of selected portraits and illustrations of
events connected with his life, service, death and burial, with
brief sketches of authors of the following poems, also forms a
compilation of rich material for all readers of Lincoln literature.</p>

<p>The object in publishing this compilation is to assist in preserving
the collection of memorials now contained in the house
in which Lincoln died, 516 Tenth Street, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p class="vbsm">The volume will be sent postpaid by the Editor at the above
address, upon receipt of its price, $1.00.</p>

<h3>THE POETIC SPIRIT OF LINCOLN</h3>

<p class="center vbsm">By <span class="smcap">Marion Mills Miller</span></p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">Some</span> years ago, while editing Henry C. Whitney's
"Life of Lincoln" I showed a photograph of the
bust of Lincoln by Johannes Gelert, the most intellectual
to my mind of all the studies of his face, to
a little Italian shoeblack, and asked him if he knew
who it was. The boy, evidently prompted by a recent
lesson at school, said questioningly, "Whittier?&mdash;Longfellow?"
I replied, "No, it is Lincoln, the great
President." He answered, "Well, he looks like a poet,
anyway."</p>

<p>This verified a conclusion to which I had already
come: Lincoln, had he lived in a region of greater
culture, such as New England, might not have adopted
the engrossing pursuits of law and politics, but, as did
Whittier, have remained longer on the farm and gradually
taken up the calling of letters, composing verse
of much the same order as our Yankee bards', and
poetry of even higher merit than some produced.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that Lincoln, shortly before
he went to Congress, wrote verse of a kind to compare
favorably with the early attempts of American
poets such as those named. Thus the two poems of
his which have been preserved, for his early lampoons
on his neighbors have happily been lost, are equal in
poetic spirit and metrical art to Whittier's "The Prisoner
for Debt," to which they are strikingly similar in
melancholic mood.</p>

<p>In 1846, at the age of 37, Lincoln conducted a literary
correspondence with a friend, <a name="transv" id="transv">William Johnson by
name, of like poetic tastes. In April of this year he
wrote the following letter to Johnson:</a></p>

       <p class="right vbsm">Tremont, April 18, 1846.</p>
       <p class="vsm"><a name="transvi" id="transvi">FRIEND JOHNSTON:</a> Your letter, written some six weeks
       since, was received in due course, and also the paper with the
       parody. It is true, as suggested it might be, that I have never
       seen Poe's "Raven"; and I very well know that a parody is
       almost entirely dependent for its interest upon the reader's
       acquaintance with the original. Still there is enough in the
       polecat, self-considered, to afford one several hearty laughs. I
       think four or five of the last stanzas are decidedly funny, particularly
       where Jeremiah "scrubbed and washed, and prayed
       and fasted."</p>

       <p>I have not your letter now before me; but, from memory, I
       think you ask me who is the author of the piece I sent you, and
       that you do so ask as to indicate a slight suspicion that I myself
       am the author. Beyond all question, I am not the author. I
       would give all I am worth, and go in debt, to be able to write so
       fine a piece as I think that is. Neither do I know who is the
       author. I met it in a straggling form in a newspaper last summer,
       and I remember to have seen it once before, about fifteen years
       ago, and this is all I know about it.</p>

       <p>The piece of poetry of my own which I alluded to, I was led
       to write under the following circumstances. In the fall of 1844,
       thinking I might aid some to carry the State of Indiana for Mr.
       Clay, I went into the neighborhood in that State in which I was
       raised, where my mother and only sister were buried, and from
       which I had been absent about fifteen years.</p>

       <p class="vbsm">That part of the country is, within itself, as unpoetical as any
       spot of the earth; but still, seeing it and its objects and inhabitants
       aroused feelings in me which were certainly poetry; though
       whether my expression of those feelings is poetry is quite another
       question. When I got to writing, the change of subject divided
       the thing into four little divisions or cantos, the first only of
       which I send you now, and may send the others hereafter.</p>

       <p class="vsm"><a name="transvii" id="transvii">FRIEND JOHNSTON:</a> You remember when I wrote you
       from Tremont last spring, sending you a little canto of what I
       called poetry, I promised to bore you with another some time.
       I now fulfil the promise. The subject of the present one is an
       insane man; his name is Matthew Gentry. He is three years
       older than I, and when we were boys we went to school together.
       He was rather a bright lad, and the son of the rich man of a very
       <span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
       poor neighborhood. At the age of nineteen he unaccountably
       became furiously mad, from which condition he gradually settled
       down into harmless insanity. When, as I told you in my other
       letter, I visited my old home in the fall of 1844, I found him
       still lingering in this wretched condition. In my poetizing
       mood, I could not forget the impression his case made upon me.
       Here is the result:</p>

<p>The poem alluded to in the first letter is undoubtedly
"Oh, Why Should the Spirit of Mortal Be <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Proud?",</span> by
William Knox, a Scottish poet, known to fame only by
its authorship. It remained the favorite of Lincoln
until his death, being frequently alluded to by him in
conversation with his friends. Because it so aptly
presents Lincoln's own spirit it is here presented in
full. During his Presidency he said:</p>

<p><br /></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"There is a poem which has been a great favorite with me
        for years, which was first shown me when a young man by a
        friend, and which I afterwards saw and cut from a newspaper
        and learned by heart. I would give a good deal to know who
        wrote it, but I have never been able to ascertain."</p>
    </div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Then, half closing his eyes, he repeated the verses:</p>

            <p>William Knox was born at Firth, in the parish of Lilliesleaf,
            in the county of Roxburghshire, on the 17th of August, 1789.
            From his early youth he composed verses. He merited the
            attention of Sir Walter Scott, who afforded him pecuniary assistance.
            He died November 12, 1825, at the age of thirty-six.</p>

<p>and tears would come unbidden to his eyes, probably
at thought of the grave (his mother's) at Gentryville,
or that in the bend of the Sangamo" (of Ann Rutledge,
his first love, who died shortly before the time set
for their wedding, and whose memory Lincoln ever
kept sacred).</p>

<p>While Lincoln, so far as can be ascertained, wrote
nothing in verse after 1846, he developed in his speeches
a literary style which is poetical in the highest sense
of that term. More than all American statesmen his
utterances and writings possess that classic quality
whose supreme expression is found in Greek literature.
This is because Lincoln had an essentially Hellenic
mind. First of all the architecture of his thought was
that of the Greek masters, who, whether as Phidias
they built the Parthenon to crown with harmonious
beauty the Acropolis, or as Homer they recorded in
swelling narrative from its dramatic beginning the
strife of the Achaeans before Troy, or even as Euclid,
they developed from postulates the relations of space,
had a deep insight into the order in which mother
nature was striving to express herself, and a reverent
impulse to aid her in bodying forth according to her
methods the ideal forms of the cosmos, the world of
beauty, no less within the soul of man than without
it, which was intended by such help to be realized as a
whole in the infinity of time, and in part in the vision
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
of every true workman. In short, Lincoln had a profound
sense of the fitness of things, that which Aristotle,
the scientific analyst of human thought and the philosopher
of its proper expression, called "poetic justice."
He strove to make his reasoning processes strictly
logical, and to this end carried with him as he rode
the legal circuit not law-books, but a copy of Euclid's
geometry, and passed his time on the way demonstrating
to his drivers the theorems therein proposed. "Demonstrate"
he said he considered to be the greatest word
in the English language. He constructed every one of
his later speeches on the plan of a Euclidean solution.
His Cooper Union speech on "Slavery as the Fathers
Viewed It," which contributed so largely to his Presidential
nomination, was such a demonstration, settling
what was thereafter never attempted to be controverted:
his contention that the makers of the Constitution
merely tolerated property in human flesh and
blood as a primitive and passing phase of civilization,
and never intended that it should be perpetuated by
the charter of the Republic.</p>

<p>So, too, the Gettysburg speech, brief as it is, is the
statement of a thesis, the principles upon which the
Fathers founded the nation, and of the heroic demonstration
of the same by the soldiers fallen on the field,
and the addition of a moral corollary of this, the high
resolve of the living to prosecute the work until the
vision of the Fathers was realized.</p>

<p>In substance of thought and in form of its presentation
the speech is as perfect a poem as ever was written,
and even in the minor qualities of artistic language&mdash;rhythm
and cadence, phonetic euphony, rhetorical
symbolism, and that subtle reminiscence of a great
literary and spiritual inheritance, the Bible, which
stands to us as Homer did to the ancients&mdash;it excels the
finest gem to be found in poetic cabinets from the
Greek Anthology downward. Only because it was not
written in the typography of verse, with capitalized
and paragraphed initial words at the beginning of each
thought-group of words, has it failed of recognition as
a poem by academic minds. Had Walt Whitman composed
the address, and printed it in the above manner,
it would now appear in every anthology of poetry published
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
since its date. To convince of this those conventional
people who must have an ocular demonstration of
form in order to compare the address with accepted
examples of poetry, I will dare to incur the condemnation
of those who rightly look upon such a departure
from Lincoln's own manner of writing the speech as
profanation, and present it in the shape of <i>vers libre.</i>
For the latter class of readers this, the greatest poem
by Lincoln, the greatest, indeed, yet produced in
America, may be preferably read in the original form
on <a href="#Page_100">page 100</a> of this collection. I trust that these,
especially if they are teachers of literature, will pardon,
for the sake of others less cultivated in poetic taste,
what may appear a duplication here, unnecessary to
themselves, of the address.</p>

<p>Lincoln attained this classic perfection of ordered
thought, and with it, as an inevitable accompaniment
this classic beauty of expression, only by great struggle.
He became a poet of the first rank only by virtue of
his moral spirit. He was continually correcting deficiencies
in his character, which were far greater than
is generally received, owing to the tendency of American
historians of the tribe of Parson Weems to find by force
illustrations of moral heroism in the youth of our great
men. Thus Lincoln is represented as a noble lad, who,
having allowed a borrowed book to be ruined by rain,
went to the owner and offered to "pull fodder" to
repay him, which the man ungenerously permitted
him to do. The truth is, that the neighbor, to whom
the book was a cherished possession, required him to
do the work in repayment, and that Lincoln not only
did it grudgingly, but afterwards lampooned the man
so severely in satiric verse that he was ashamed to
show himself at neighborhood gatherings. All the
people about Gentryville feared Lincoln's caustic wit,
and disliked him for it, although they were greatly
impressed with his ability exhibited thereby. Lincoln
recognized his moral obliquity, and curbed his propensity
for satire, which was a case of that "exercise of
natural faculty" which affects all gifted persons. And
when he left that region he visited all the neighbors,
and asked pardon of those whom he had ridiculed. The
true Lincoln is a far better example to boys than the
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
fictitious one, in that he had more unlovely traits at
first than the average lad, yet he reformed, with the
result that, when he went to new scenes, he speedily
became the most popular young man in the neighborhood.
He was one of those who</p>

<p>The reformation of his character by self examination
and determination not to make the same mistake
again seems to have induced similar effects and methods
for their attainment in the case of his intellectual development.
Whatever the connection, both regenerations
proceeded apace. Lincoln at first was a shallow
thinker, accepting without examination the views of
others, especially popular statesmen, such as Henry
Clay, whose magnetic personality was drawing to himself
the high-spirited young men of the West. Some
of the political doctrines which Lincoln then adopted
he retained to the end, these being on subjects such as
taxation and finance whose moral bearing was not
apparent, and therefore into which he never inquired
closely, for Lincoln's mind could not be profoundly interested
in any save a moral question. When he found
that a revered statesman was weak upon a crucial
moral issue, he repressed his innate tendency to loyalty
and rejected him. Thus, after a visit to Henry Clay
in Kentucky, when the slavery question was arising to
vex the country despite the efforts the aged statesman
had made to settle it by the compromise of 1850,
Lincoln returned disillusioned, having found that the
light he himself possessed on the subject was clearer
than that of his old leader. The eulogy which he delivered
on the death of Clay, which occurred shortly
afterward (in 1852), is the most perfunctory of all his
addresses.</p>

<p>Indeed, not till the time of the Repeal of the Missouri
Compromise of 1854, which brought Lincoln back into
politics by its overthrow of what he regarded as the
constitutional exclusion of slavery from the Territories,
did he rise to his highest powers as a thinker and
speaker. Lincoln had been defeated for reelection to
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Congress because of his opposition, though not highly
moral in character, to the popular Mexican war, and,
regarding himself as a political failure, he had devoted
himself to law. His most notable speech in the House
of Representatives, a well composed satirical arraignment
of President Polk for throwing the country into
war, had failed utterly of its intended effect, probably
because of its trimming partisan tone. In 1854 he
was relieved of the trammels of party, the Whigs
having gone to smash. Anti-slavery had become a
great moral movement, and he was drawn into its
current. Almost at once he became its Western leader.
His speech against the Repeal of the Missouri Compromise
which had been effected by his inveterate
antagonist, Senator Stephen A. Douglas, was his first
classic achievement in argumentative oratory. While
in the greater aspect of artistic composition, the form
of the address as a whole, his master was Euclid, in
minor points the influence of Shakespeare, of whom
Lincoln had become a great reader, was apparent, as
indicated by a quotation from the dramatist, and an
application to Senator Douglas of the scene of Lady
Macbeth trying to wash out the indelible stain upon
her hand. Also the Bible was the source of strong and
telling phrases and figures of speech. Thus he denominated
slavery as "the great Behemoth of danger,"
and asked, "shall the strong grip of the nation be
loosened upon him, to intrust him to the hands of his
feeble keepers?"</p>

<p>And, in the following passage, characteristic of the
new Lincoln, I think that either Shakespeare and the
Bible had combined to inspire him with graphic description
of character and moral indignation, or they enforced
these native powers.</p>

<p>"Again, you have among you a sneaking individual
of the class of native tyrants known as the 'Slave-Dealer'.
He watches your necessities, and crawls up
to buy your slave at a speculative price. If you cannot
help it, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you
drive him from your door. You despise him utterly.
You do not recognize him as a friend, or even as an
honest man. Your children must not play with his;
they may rollick freely with the little negroes, but not
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
with the slave-dealer's children. If you are obliged to
deal with him you try to get through the job without
so much as touching him. It is common with you to
join hands with the men you meet, but with the slave-dealer
you avoid the ceremony&mdash;instinctively shrinking
from the snaky contact."</p>

<p>Of Lincoln's critical appreciation of Shakespeare
Frank B. Carpenter, the artist of the "First Reading
of the Emancipation Proclamation" (see illustration
on <a href="#Page_206">page 206</a>), writes in his "Six Months at the White
House with Abraham Lincoln" as follows:</p>

<p>"<a name="transxvii" id="transxvii">Presently the conversation turned upon Shakspeare,
of whom it is well known Mr. Lincoln was very fond.
He once remarked, 'It matters not to me whether
Shakspeare be well or ill acted; with him the thought
suffices.</a>' Edwin Booth was playing an engagement
at this time at Grover's Theatre. He had been announced
for the coming evening in his famous part of
<i>Hamlet.</i> The President had never witnessed his representation
of this character, and he proposed being
present. The mention of this play, which I afterward
learned had at all times a peculiar charm for Mr.
Lincoln's mind, waked up a train of thought I was not
prepared for. Said he,&mdash;and his words have often
returned to me with a sad interest since his own assassination,&mdash;'There
is one passage of the play of "Hamlet"
which is very apt to be slurred over by the actor, or
omitted altogether, which seems to me the choicest
part of the play. It is the soliloquy of the King,
after the murder. It always struck me as one of the
finest touches of nature in the world.'</p>

scene, he took up the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"'The opening of the play of "King Richard the

<p>"'Now,' said he, 'this is all wrong. Richard, you remember,
had been, and was then plotting the destruction
of his brothers, to make room for himself. Outwardly,
the most loyal to the newly crowned king,
secretly he could scarcely contain his impatience at the
obstacles still in the way of his own elevation. He
appears upon the stage, just after the crowning of
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
Edward, burning with repressed hate and jealousy.
The prologue is the utterance of the most intense
bitterness and satire.' Then, unconsciously assuming
the character, Mr. Lincoln repeated, also from memory,
Richard's soliloquy, rendering it with a degree of force
and power that made it seem like a new creation to
me. Though familiar with the passage from boyhood,
I can truly say that never till that moment had I fully
appreciated its spirit. I could not refrain from laying
down my palette and brushes, and applauding heartily
upon his conclusion, saying, at the same time, half in
earnest, that I was not sure but that he had made a
mistake in the choice of a profession, considerably, as
may be imagined, to his amusement. Mr. Sinclair has
since repeatedly said to me that he never heard these
choice passages of Shakspeare rendered with more
effect by the most famous of modern actors."</p>

<p>Lincoln's sense of the classic phrase seems to have
been native with him, for we find it in his earliest
utterances. Such a phrase appears in homely proverbial
form in his first speech: "My politics are short and
sweet, like the old woman's dance." Impaired in
rhythm of thought and sound by an awkward, though
logical, parenthetical expression, another phrase stands
out in a "spread-eagle" passage from his first formal
address, that on "The Perpetuation of Our Political
Institutions."</p>

<p>"All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined,
with all the treasure of earth (our own excepted)
in its military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander,
could not by force <i>take a drink from the Ohio or make a
track on the Blue Ridge</i> in a trial of a thousand years."</p>

<p>And in a eulogy on Washington, Lincoln early
achieved a line which in phonetic quality, rhetorical
figure and rhythmic cadence is pure poetry, though
not of an exceptional order.</p>

<p>"In solemn awe we pronounce the name, and in its
naked deathless splendor leave it shining on."</p>

<p>In an article entitled "Lincoln's Literary Experiments,"
by John G. Nicolay, one of Lincoln's two
private secretaries, which was published in the Century
Magazine for April, 1894, are reproduced Lincoln's
notes of one lyceum lecture on "Niagara Falls," and
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
the text of another on "Discoveries, Inventions and
Improvements." These, however, detract, if anything,
from Lincoln's reputation as a writer, for in
choice of subjects and in style of treatment there is
seen an almost discreditable stooping of a man of
genius, even in his function of teacher, to the low popular
taste of the West at the time. In the first lecture
Lincoln presented the statistics of the water power of
Niagara Falls for each minute, and led his hearers from
this base to the "contemplation of the vast power the
sun is constantly exerting in the quiet noiseless operation
of lifting water up to be rained down again." Yet
at this point he stopped short of his duty as an educator,
for he made no suggestion as to the utilization
of this power. He was satisfied with giving the people
what they had come for&mdash;the pleasant excitation of
a mental faculty, that of the imagination in its primary
form of wonder at the grandeur of the material universe.
In short, he was acting as a mere entertainer&mdash;as so
many of our public men do now at "Chautauquas."</p>

<p>In the second lecture he <a name="transxx" id="transxx">performed this function
in a still more</a> discreditable manner, by catering to the
unworthy demand of his hearers for obvious and familiar
humorous conceptions to grasp which would cause
them no mental exertion. Thus, in speaking of the
inventions of the locomotive and telegraph, already
old enough for the first inevitable similitudes and
jocose remarks about them to be current, he said:</p>

<p>"The iron horse is panting and impatient to carry
him (man) everywhere in no time; and the lightning
stands ready harnessed to take and bring his tidings
in a trifle less than no time."</p>

<p>This reveals Lincoln's taste for the characteristic
American humor of exaggeration, which was later to
afford him relief from the stress and strain of his duties
as President in the works of "Petroleum V. Nasby"
and "Artemus Ward," writers, however, with a quaint
originality which lifted them and their admirers above
the plane of humorous composition and appreciation
of the preceding decade. Indeed, Lincoln developed
his own power of witty expression to a degree excelling
that of the writers he admired, and in quality of
product, if not in quantity (for the greater part of the
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
"funny stories" attributed to him, thank heaven, are
apocryphal) he stands in the front rank of the American
humorists of his generation.</p>

<p>And as the poet and the wit are near akin through
this common appeal to the imagination, Lincoln, had
he overcome the obsession of melancholy in his nature
which was the mood in which he resorted to poetry,
and which early limited his taste for it to verse of a sad
and reflective kind, might have become a literary craftsman
of the order of Holmes, whose poetry in the main
was bright and joyous, and, even when he occasionally
touched upon such subjects as death, was, as we have
seen, informed with inspiring Hellenic beauty rather
than depressing Hebraic moralization. It was in his
sad moments, says Henry C. Whitney, that the mind
of Lincoln "gravitated toward the weird, sombre and
mystical. In his normal and tranquil state of mind,
'The Last Leaf,' by Oliver Wendell Holmes, was his
favorite" (poem). It was Lincoln's happy lot to rise
in the realm of oratory by the power of his poetic spirit
higher than any American, save probably Emerson, has
done in other fields of literature. On the theme of
slavery, where his unerring moral sense had free sway,
he became our supreme orator, transcending even
Webster in grandeur of thought and beauty of its expression.
His periods are not as sonorous as the
Olympian New England orator's, but their accents will
reach as far and resound even longer by the carrying
and sustaining power of the ideas which they express.
Indeed, it is on the wings supplied by Lincoln that
Webster's most significant conception, that of the nature
of the Constitution, is even now borne along,
because of the uplifting ideality which Lincoln gave
it by more broadly applying it to the nation itself as an
examplar and preserver to the world of ideal government.</p>

<p>Webster said: "It is, sir, the people's Constitution,
the people's Government; made for the people; made
by the people; and answerable to the people."</p>

<p>This he made the thesis for an argument which was
to be followed by a magnificent peroration ending with
a sentiment, calculated for use as a toast at political
banquets, and as a patriotic slogan: "Liberty and
Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!"
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Lincoln with purer taste, the expression of which, be
it said to Webster's credit, had been made possible by
the acceptance of the earlier statesman's contention,
assumed the thesis as placed beyond all controversy,
and, making it the exhortation of his speech, gave to it
the character of a sacred adjuration: "That we here
highly resolve &hellip; that government of the people,
by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from
the earth."</p>

<p>Another example of Lincoln's ability to improve the
composition of another writer is the closing paragraph
of his first inaugural address. The President-elect had
submitted the manuscript of this most important
speech, which would be universally scrutinized to find
what policy he would adopt toward the seceded States,
to Seward, his chosen Secretary of State, for criticism
and suggestion. Mr. Seward approved the argument,
but advised the addition of a closing paragraph "to
meet and remove prejudice and passion in the South;
and despondency in the East." He submitted two
paragraphs of his own as alternative models. The
second was in that poetic vein which occasionally
cropped out in Seward's speeches, and over which
Lincoln on better acquaintance was wont good-naturedly
to rally him. It is evidence of Lincoln's predilection
for poetic language, at least at the close of a
speech, that he adopted the latter paragraph. It ran:</p>

<p>"I close. We are not, we must not be, aliens or enemies,
but fellow-countrymen and brethren. Although
passion has strained our bonds of affection too hardly,
they must not, I am sure they will not, be broken.
The mystic chords which, proceeding from so many
battlefields and so many patriot graves, pass through
all the hearts and all hearths in this broad continent
of ours, will yet again harmonize in their ancient
music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of
the nation."</p>

<p>Lincoln, by deft touches which reveal a literary taste
beyond that of any statesman of his time, indeed beyond
that which he himself had yet exhibited, transformed
this passage into his peroration. His emendations
were largely in the way of excision of unnecessary
phrases, resolution of sentences broken in construction
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
into several shorter, more direct ones, and change of
general and vague terms in rhetorical figure to concrete
and picturesque words. He wrote:</p>

<p>"I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies. Though passion may have
strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.
The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every
battle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and
hearth-stone all over this broad land, will yet swell the
chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they
will be, by the better angels of our nature."</p>

<p>More than the persuasive argument and gentle yet
determined spirit of the address, it was the chaste
beauty and tender feeling of these closing words which
convinced the people that Lincoln measured up to the
high mental and moral stature demanded of one who
was to be their leader through the most critical period
that had arisen in the life of the nation.</p>

<p>The second inaugural address, coming so shortly
before the President's death, formed unintentionally
his farewell address. It has the spirit and tone of
prophecy. The Bible, in thought and expression, was
its inspiration. The first two of its three paragraphs
ring like a chapter from Isaiah, chief of the poet seers
of old. The concluding paragraph is an apostolic benediction
such as Paul or John might have delivered.</p>

<p>"With malice toward none; with charity for all;
with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the
right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to
bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall
have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan&mdash;to
do all which may achieve and cherish a just and
lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations."</p>

poems. In 1843 Miss Ward married Dr. Samuel
Gridley Howe. In 1861, while on a visit to the camp
near Washington, with Governor John A. Andrew and
other friends, Mrs. Howe wrote to the air of "John
Brown's Body" the "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
which has become so popular. She also published
several books of poems. She espoused the Woman-Suffrage
movement in 1869, and devoted much of her
time to the cause. She died in 1910.</p>

<p>This poem was written by Mrs. Howe in her ninetieth
year and read by her in Symphony Hall, Boston, on
the centenary of the martyred President's birthday,
February 12, 1909.</p>

<p class="cption">MONUMENT TO THE MOTHER OF LINCOLN</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">Nancy Hanks Lincoln</span> died October 5, 1818,
aged thirty-five years. The design of this
monument is by Thompson Stickle, and it was
constructed by J.&nbsp;S. Culver of Springfield, Illinois, and
dedicated October 2, 1902.</p>

<p>In the construction of the monument in Spencer
County, Indiana, Mr. Culver used as much of the granite
as possible from the National Lincoln Monument
before it was reconstructed.</p>

<p>The face of this block is handsomely hand-carved.
As the Scroll of Time unrolls, it reveals the name of
"Nancy Hanks Lincoln." The ivy represents affection
and the branch of oak nobility.</p>

<p>The public celebration of the centenary of Lincoln's
birth was held in the town of North Adams, Massachusetts,
February 12, 1909.</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Thomas F. Cassidy, in his address, said:
"One hundred years ago today, in Hardin County,
Kentucky, there was ushered into being the child,
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>"As God selected Mary, the humble girl of Judea,
to be the mother of the Saviour of mankind and she
gave birth to Him in the stable at Bethlehem, so it
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was ordained that in the lowly log cabin of the Kentucky
wilderness, Nancy Hanks should receive into the
protection of her sheltering arms the child who was
destined to be the Saviour of the Republic."</p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">This chair</span> was used by Mr. Lincoln in his law
office at Springfield, Illinois, where, before leaving
for the City of Washington after his election as
President, he wrote his Inaugural Address and formed
his Cabinet, frequently conferring with his twenty-year
law partner, William H. Herndon, on such matters, and
adopting changes as suggested if he considered them
advisable. It was presented to O.&nbsp;H. Oldroyd while
living in the Lincoln Homestead, Springfield, by Mr.
Herndon, March 18, 1886.</p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">James Riley</span> was born in the hamlet of Tang, one
mile from the town of Ballymahon, County Longford,
Ireland, and two miles from Lissoy, County
Westmeath, the home of Oliver Goldsmith&mdash;on the road
between the two&mdash;August 15, 1848. Published <i>Poems,</i>
1888; <i>Songs of Two Peoples,</i> 1898, and <i>Christy of
Rathglin,</i> a novel, in 1907. His poem <i>The American
Flag,</i> has been rated often as the best poem written
to our banner. Four lines on the loss of the Titanic
brought from Captain Rostron words in which he said:
"With such praise one feels on a higher plane, and
must keep so, to be worthy of continuance."</p>

The "Wigwam," as it was called, covered a space

the ground-floor and galleries, about 8,000. A

every day to overflowing. The Convention met on

his father, Thomas, in 1831, near Farmington,
Coles Co., Ill. The father died here in 1851 and
the step-mother, Sarah Bush Lincoln, in 1869. After
Lincoln was elected President in 1860, and before leaving
for Washington to be inaugurated, he visited his
mother in this cabin for the last time. As he was
leaving her, she made a prediction of his tragic death.
With arms about his neck, with tears streaming down
her cheeks, she declared it was the last time she would
ever see him alive, and it proved to be so.</p>

<p>Lincoln once said, "I was told that I never would
make a lawyer if I did not understand what 'demonstrate'
means. I left my situation in Springfield, went
to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give
any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight. I
there found out what demonstrate means."</p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">On</span> Monday, February 11, 1861, Mr. Lincoln and
family in company with a party left Springfield,
Illinois, for Washington, D.&nbsp;C. A light rain mixed
with snow was falling at the time which made the occasion
a somewhat gloomy one. Mr. Lincoln appeared
on the rear platform of the car where he bade farewell
to his neighbors in the following address:</p>

<p>"My friends, no one not in my position can appreciate
the sadness I feel at this parting. To this
people I owe all that I am. Here I have lived more than
a quarter of a century. Here my children were born, and
here one of them lies buried.</p>

<p>"I know not how soon I shall see you again. A duty
devolves upon me which is greater, perhaps, than that
which has devolved upon any other man since the days
of Washington. He never would have succeeded except
for the aid of divine Providence, upon which he at all
times relied.</p>

<p>"I feel that I cannot succeed without the same divine
aid which sustained him; and on the same Almighty
Being I place my reliance for support, and I hope you,
my friends, will pray that I may receive the divine
assistance, without which I cannot succeed, but with
which success is certain. Again, I bid you an affectionate
farewell."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln thought that there is a time to joke and
pray; and if, as his detractors affirm, he joked all the
way to Washington, if he did not pray also (as we believe
he did, and fervently, too) he at least desired the
prayers of others, as the circumstances recorded in the

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">On</span> the 22nd of February, 1861, Washington's birthday,
on his journey to Washington, to assume the
Presidency, Mr. Lincoln raised a new flag over Independence
Hall, then went inside and spoke as <span style="white-space: nowrap;">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself
standing in this place, where were collected together
the wisdom, the patriotism, the devotion to principle
from which sprang the institutions under which we
live. You have kindly suggested to me that in my hands
is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country.
I can say in return, sirs, that all the political sentiments
I entertain have been drawn, so far as I have been able
to draw them, from the sentiments which originated
in and were given to the world from this hall. I have
never had a feeling, politically, that did not spring
from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of
Independence. I have often pondered over the dangers
which were incurred by the men who assembled here
and framed and adopted that Declaration. I have
pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers
and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence.
I have often inquired of myself what great principle
or idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long
together. It was not the mere matter of separation of
the colonies from the motherland, but that sentiment
in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty,
not alone to the people of this country, but hope to all
the world, for all future time. It was that which gave
promise that in due time the weight would be lifted
from the shoulders of all men and that all should have
an equal chance. This is the sentiment embodied in
the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>"Now, my friends, can this country be saved on that
basis? If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest
men in the world if I can help to save it. But if
this country cannot be saved without giving up that
principle, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated
on this spot than surrender it."</p>

<p>Four years and two months later, April 22, 1865,
his body lay, assassinated, on the very spot where he
had made the above remarks, then being taken to
Springfield, Illinois, for burial.</p>

District of Columbia as the National Capital,
and provided that prior to the first Monday of
December, 1800, the Commissioners should have finished
a suitable building for the sessions of Congress.
The site of the Capitol was included in L'Enfant's plan
for the city. The cornerstone was laid September 18,
1793, with Masonic rites, George Washington officiating.
The wings of the central building were completed in
1811, and were partially burned by the British, in 1814.
The entire central building was finished in 1827. The
cornerstone of the extension was laid by President
Fillmore, July 4, 1851. The extensions were first occupied
by Congress 1857 and 1859. Up to that time the
Senate Chamber was the present Supreme Court Room,
and the Hall of Representatives was the present
National Statuary Hall. The dome was finished during
the administration of President Lincoln. The total cost
of the Capitol building and grounds was about thirty
million dollars. The remains of President Lincoln were
escorted from the White House to the Capitol at three
o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, on the 19th of April, 1865. The number
in the procession was estimated at forty thousand, and
that many more were spectators along the route. The
burial service was conducted by Dr. Gurley. The special
train bearing the remains left at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, Friday,

<p>Rev. Dr. Lyman Whitney Allen of Newark, New
Jersey, had for his guest Chief Justice Wendell Phillips
Stafford of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
Judge Stafford addressed the Men's Club of Dr.
Allen's church one evening, and next day, in company
with his host, visited the Lincoln statue on the court-house
plaza. On the train that bore him back to
Washington that day, Judge Stafford wrote the poem
on the Statue. (See <a href="#Page_236">page 236</a>).</p>

<p>A few weeks thereafter Dr. Allen visited his friend,
the judge, in Washington, and they made a little pilgrimage
to the New York Avenue Presbyterian church.
In the Lincoln pew Dr. Allen sat and meditated, and on
his way back he wrote the verses.</p>

<p>"I had seen the Lincoln statue many times," says Dr.
Allen, "but, somehow, I could not get started on the
poem I knew could be written around it." And Judge
Stafford wrote to his friend in Newark: "I had seen
the Lincoln pew a score of times without poetic result,
yet you come on a one-day visit and carry away the
inspiration needed."</p>

Oswego, New York, 1862, and is a son of the late
Anthony Schuyler, who was for many years
rector of Grace Church, Orange, New Jersey. He belongs
to the well-known family of that name, being
seventh in descent from Philip Peterse Schuyler,
founder of the family, who came to this country from
Holland and settled in Albany in 1650. He studied at
Oxford University, England, and the General Theological
Seminary of New York. Has held positions in
Calvary Church, New York; Trinity Church, Newport,
Rhode Island, and was for several years dean of
the Cathedral at Davenport, Iowa, under the late

in February, 1900. Has written extensively for journals
and periodicals. Among the bound publications which
bear his name as author are <i>A Fisher of Men,</i> a biography
of the late Churchill Satterlee, priest and missionary,
son of the first Bishop of Washington; <i>Studies

OF THE CEMETERY AT GETTYSBURG</a></h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">Four</span> score and seven years ago our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived
in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal.</p>

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing
whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and
so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a portion of that field as a final resting place for those
who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
this.</p>

<p class="vbsm">But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate&mdash;we cannot
consecrate&mdash;we cannot hallow&mdash;this ground. The
brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remember
what we say here, but it can never forget what they
did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather
for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us,&mdash;that from these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they gave
their last full measure of devotion&mdash;that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
vain&mdash;that this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom&mdash;and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people, shall not perish from
the earth.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly there were many in the audience who
fully appreciated the beauty of the President's address,
and many of those who read it on the following day
perceived its wondrous character; but it is apparent
that its full force and grandeur were not generally
recognized then, either by its auditors or its readers.
Not until the war had ended and the great leader had
fallen did the nation realize that this speech had given
to Gettysburg another claim to immortality and to
American eloquence its highest glory."&mdash;From the
monograph on the Gettysburg Address, by Maj.
William H. Lambert.</p>

County, Pennsylvania, on the 11th of January,
1825. Died in Berlin, Germany, on the 19th of
December, 1878. His boyhood was passed on a farm
near Kennett. He learned to read at four, began to
write at an early age, and from his twelfth year wrote
poems, novels and historical essays, but mostly poems.
In 1837 the family moved to Westchester, and there and
at Unionville he had five years of high-school training.
His first poem printed was contributed to the <i>Saturday
Evening Post,</i> in 1841, and those to the <i>New York
Tribune</i> from abroad, written in 1844, were widely read
and shortly after his return were collected and published
in <i>Views Afoot, or Europe Seen With Knapsack
and Staff.</i> With a friend he bought a printing office in
1846, and began to publish the <i>Phoenixville Pioneer,</i> but
it was as a poet that he excelled above most other vocations.</p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap"><a name="Marion_Mills_Miller" id="Marion_Mills_Miller">Marion Mills Miller</a></span> was born at Eaton,
Ohio, February 27, 1864. He was graduated
from Princeton in 1886, and for several years
thereafter was an instructor there in the English department.
In 1889 he received the degree of Doctor
of Literature from his Alma Mater. Since 1893 he has
been engaged in literary and social reform work in
New York City. He has published some verse and
fiction, but his most notable work has been in the
fields of translation and history. He has edited <i>The
Classics&mdash;Greek and Latin</i> (15 volumes), published
in 1909, and <i>Great Debates in American History</i> (14
volumes), published in 1913.</p>

<p>In 1907 he edited the Centenary Edition of <i>The Life
and Works of Abraham Lincoln</i> in 10 volumes, logically
arranged for ready reference. The <i>Life of Lincoln</i>
was published separately in 1908 in two volumes. It
is based on a manuscript by Henry C. Whitney, whose
name it bears as author, although the second volume,
<i>Lincoln, the President,</i> was largely written by Dr.
Miller. The late Major William H. Lambert, president
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of the Lincoln Fellowship, called it "the best of
the shorter biographies of Lincoln." Dr. Miller has
also edited <i>The Wisdom of Lincoln</i> (1908), a small
book of extracts from Lincoln's speeches and writings.
He wrote the following poem, "Lincoln and Stanton,"
especially for <span class="smcap">The Poets' Lincoln.</span></p>

<p>The first reference in it is to the Manny-McCormick
case over the patent rights of the reaping machine, in
which Lincoln had been at first selected as principal
pleader, but was superseded by Edwin M. Stanton.
Having thoroughly prepared himself, he offered his
assistance to Stanton, but was brusquely repulsed.
He was so hurt that he felt like leaving the court room,
but decided, in loyalty to his client, to remain, and,
leaving his place among counsel, took a seat in the
audience. Despite his injured feelings he was filled
with admiration for Stanton's able and successful conduct
of the case. Lincoln, probably referring to a slur
of Stanton reported to him, said that he would have
to go back to Illinois and "study more law," since the
"college-bred" lawyers were pushing hard the "cornfield"
ones.</p>

<p>The second reference is to Stanton's criticism of
Lincoln's conservative course during the first months
of his Presidency; "that imbecile at the White House,"
he called him. Stanton as Attorney-General at the
close of Buchanan's administration had done effective
work in foiling the plans of the Confederacy, and he
believed in forceful measures to put down the rebellion
in its incipiency.</p>

<p>The third reference is to the virtually enforced resignation
of Simon Cameron, Lincoln's first Secretary of
War, and Lincoln's choice to succeed him of Stanton,
whom he realized to be the best equipped man in the
country for the place.</p>

<p>The fourth reference is to Stanton's remark by the
bedside of Lincoln as the stricken President ceased
breathing: "There lies the greatest leader of men the
world ever saw."</p>

H. Hall, of the Church of the Epiphany, opened
the service by reading from the Episcopal Burial
Service for the Dead. Bishop Matthew Simpson of
the Methodist Church then offered prayer, and the Rev.
Dr. Phineas D. Gurley, pastor of the New York Avenue
Presbyterian Church, at which Mr. Lincoln and his
family attended, delivered a sermon. The Rev. E.&nbsp;H.
Gray, D.D., of the E Street Baptist Church, closed

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">Phineas Densmore Gurley</span>, born at Hamilton,
New York, 1816. Educated at Union
College, Schenectady, New York. Taught during
vacation, graduated 1837. Studied theology at the
Theological Seminary, Princeton, New Jersey. Was
licensed to preach in 1840. In 1840 he went to Indianapolis,
Indiana, and took charge of a church. In 1849
he removed to Dayton, Ohio, taking charge of a
church, and in 1853 moved to Washington, D.&nbsp;C., and
took charge of a Presbyterian Church on F Street,
afterwards Willard Hall. In 1858 was elected Chaplain
of the United States Senate. In July, 1859, the Second
Presbyterian Church and the F Street Church united,
and were known as the New York Avenue Presbyterian
Church, Dr. Gurley becoming its pastor from March,
1861, until his death. President Lincoln was a pew holder
and a regular attendant, but was not a member. On one
occasion the President remarked, "I like Dr. Gurley, he
doesn't preach politics. I get enough of that during the
week, and when I go to church I like to hear gospel."</p>

<p>When the President was assassinated Dr. Gurley
was sent for and remained with the President until
he breathed his last.</p>

<p>As soon as the spirit took its flight, Secretary Stanton
turned to Dr. Gurley and said, "Doctor, will you say
something?" After a brief pause, Dr. Gurley said,
"Let us talk with God," and offered a touching prayer.
Dr. Gurley died September 30, 1868.</p>

the City Hall at least twenty thousand persons
were assembled in the immediate neighborhood.
While awaiting the arrival of the procession a number
of German singing bands were marched into the open
space before the Hall, and arranged on either side of
the entrance, preparatory to the singing of a requiem
to the dead. The procession entered the Park at about
half-past eleven o'clock, and the hearse stopped before
the entrance to the Hall. Here the coffin was immediately
taken from the hearse and carried up the stairs
to the catafalque which had been prepared for its
reception, while the singing societies rendered two very
appropriate dirges.</p>

<p>The interior of the City Hall had been decorated
with much taste. Across the dome a black curtain was
drawn, and the rays of light thus conducted fell subdued
upon the sad but imposing spectacle.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">Phoebe Cary</span> was born near Cincinnati, Ohio,
September 24, 1824. Her advantages for education
were somewhat better than those of her sister Alice,
whose almost inseparable companion she became at
an early age. They were quite different, however,
in temperament, in person and in mental constitution.
Phoebe began to write verse at the age of seventeen
years, and one of her earliest poems, <i>Nearer Home,</i>
beginning with "One sweetly solemn thought," won her
a world-wide reputation. In the joint housekeeping in
New York she took from choice (Alice being for many
years an invalid) the larger share of duties upon herself,
and hence found little opportunity for literary work.
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
In society, however, she was brilliant, but at all times
kindly. She wrote a touching tribute to her sister's
memory, published in the <i>Ladies' Repository</i> a few days
before her own death, which occurred at Newport, R.&nbsp;I.,
July 31, 1871. In the volume of <i>Poems of Alice and
Phoebe Cary</i> (Philadelphia, 1850) but about one-third
were written by Phoebe. Her independently published
books are <i>Poems and Parodies</i> (1854), and <i>Poems of
Faith, Hope and Love</i> (1868).</p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">On</span> the 22nd of October, 1887, this statue by Saint
Gaudens was unveiled, Mr. Eli Bates donating
$40,000 for that purpose. There is a vast oval
of cut stone, thirty by sixty feet, the interior fashioned
to form a classic bench, and the statue stands on a
stone pedestal. The sculptor represents him as an
orator, just risen from his chair, which is shown behind
him, and waiting for the audience to become quiet before
beginning his speech. The attitude is that always
assumed by Lincoln at the beginning&mdash;one hand behind
him, and the other grasping the lapel of his coat.
He appears the very incarnation of rugged grandeur
which held the master mind of this age.</p>

18, 1827, in Ogden, New York. He lived
the ordinary life of a country boy, going to school
six months in the year till he was fourteen, after which
he had to work on the farm in summer. His books had
more interest to him than his work, and he managed
to learn more out of school than in it. At sixteen he
wrote articles in verse and prose for magazines and
journals. He was a contributor to the <i>Atlantic Monthly.</i></p>

<p>During the great rebellion, he wrote several stories
of the war: <i>The Drummer Boy,</i> 1863, and <i>The Three
Scouts,</i> 1865. On the return of peace he spent some
four months in the principal southern States, for the
purpose of gaining accurate views of the condition of
society there after the war. He published the result
of these observations June, 1866, in a volume entitled,
<i>The South.</i> A collected edition of his poems was published
in 1869, entitled <i>The Vagabonds, and Other
Poems.</i></p>

At Edinburgh, Scotland, George E. Bissell, sculptor</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="drpp"><span class="dcap">It</span> is within an inclosed cemetery, known as the
Calton burying ground, which is separated from
the Calton Hill by a wide thoroughfare. The
statue is the work of an American sculptor, George
E. Bissell. It is a fine bronze figure, and rests on a
massive granite pedestal. The figure at the base is
that of a freed negro holding up a wreath. On one
face of the pedestal are Lincoln's words, "To preserve
the jewel of liberty in the framework of freedom."
The statue is a memorial not alone to Lincoln; the
legend on the pedestal tells that this plot of ground was
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
given by the lord provost and town council of Edinburgh
to Wallace Bruce, United States Consul, and
dedicated as a burial place for Scottish soldiers of the
American Civil War, 1861-65. Cut in the granite are
the names and records of Scots who fought to preserve
the Union, and who have found their last resting place
in this old burying ground at the Scottish capital.</p>

New York, December 23, 1862. His mother removed
to Yellow Springs, Ohio, when he was four
years old, and he received his education at the public
school there, afterward studying at Antioch College
of that town, a college made illustrious by its first President,
Horace Mann, who died there. Graduated in
1883, all by himself, later receiving as Master of Arts,
also LL.D. He taught for a year in a country district
school, then entered the faculty of his Alma Mater,
where he was a tutor for nine years. Was professor
of Greek, Geology and Astronomy. He joined the
Christian Endeavor Society in 1888, and by it was led
to become a member of the Presbyterian Church at
Yellow Springs. When but a boy he began to write,
and edited numerous journals. Later edited an amateur
paper, also a town paper. His first paid contribution
was a poem accepted in 1881 by <i>The Christian
Union,</i> now <i>The Outlook.</i> Wrote articles often for
<i>The Golden Rule,</i> now <i>The Christian Endeavor World,</i>
and for the <i>Sunday School Times.</i></p>

<p>In December, 1891, he went to Boston and became
managing editor of <i>The Golden Rule,</i> a position which
he still holds. Since then the paper has changed its
name and three other papers added&mdash;<i>The Junior
Christian Endeavor World,</i> <i>Junior Work</i> and <i>Union
Work,</i> all edited by Mr. Wells. He is also Editorial
Secretary of the United Society of Christian Endeavor
and in editorial charge of all its publications.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells' first book, then entitled <i>Golden Rule
Meditations,</i> but now <i>The Upward Look,</i> was published
in 1893. Since then every year has seen from one to
ten additions to his list of productions until they now
number fifty-eight volumes in all. He is a director of
the Union Rescue Mission and of the Chinese Mission
of Boston. Is a member of the American Sunday-School
Lesson Committee, an important part of his
work being his association with Dr. F.&nbsp;N. Peloubet in
writing the well-known <i>Select Notes</i> on the International
Sunday-School Lessons.</p>

     <p>Every effort has been made to faithfully reproduce the original book
     in this etext. The inconsistent, alternate and archaic spelling and
     usage that one would expect in a collection of poets and authors from
     1915 and earlier have been preserved. Errors in the Index, obvious
     and simple enough to be assumed typesetter's errors, have been
     corrected. Other problems and corrections are listed below.</p>
